        <h1>Farmhouse Interior Design Style — A Comprehensive Overview</h1>
        <p>Rustic • Cozy • Timeless</p>
      </header>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Farmhouse interior design embodies warmth, simplicity, and rustic charm. Rooted in rural living, this style blends practicality with coziness, offering a welcoming environment that feels both traditional and timeless. Modern farmhouse design reinterprets these elements through a fresh, contemporary lens, balancing old-world character with modern comfort.</p>

      <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
      <p>The farmhouse aesthetic originated from the practical homes of farmers across Europe and early America. These interiors were built using readily available materials like wood and stone, focusing on function rather than form. Over time, the organic beauty of these utilitarian spaces became admired for their authenticity and charm.</p>
      <p>In recent decades, the farmhouse style has evolved into the “modern farmhouse” trend, popularized by designers who mix rustic features with clean, contemporary elements—white walls, open layouts, and industrial accents—creating a perfect blend of old and new.</p>

      <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>
      <p>At its heart, farmhouse design celebrates comfort, simplicity, and togetherness. It emphasizes natural materials, handcrafted furniture, and spaces designed for gathering. The philosophy values authenticity—embracing imperfections and celebrating the story behind every object. Rather than focusing on perfection, it seeks warmth and character that come from age and use.</p>

      <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
      <p>Farmhouse interiors are defined by open layouts, exposed wooden beams, shiplap walls, and vintage-inspired furnishings. Neutral tones and organic textures dominate the space, while large, inviting furniture pieces create a sense of comfort. Décor often includes weathered wood, metal fixtures, and natural fabrics like linen and cotton.</p>
      <p>The combination of rustic and refined elements—like reclaimed wood paired with sleek lighting—creates a balanced aesthetic that feels both grounded and stylish.</p>

      <h2>Color Palette and Materials</h2>
      <p>The farmhouse color palette is typically soft and neutral—whites, creams, beige, and warm grays—accented by muted greens, blues, or earthy browns. These tones evoke the natural beauty of the countryside while maintaining a light and airy atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Materials play a key role: reclaimed wood, wrought iron, natural stone, jute, and rattan bring authenticity and texture. Painted and distressed finishes add to the lived-in charm that defines this beloved style.</p>

      <h2>Furniture and Decor</h2>
      <p>Farmhouse furniture combines sturdy craftsmanship with inviting comfort. Tables and chairs often feature simple, traditional lines made from solid wood. Upholstered sofas, slipcovered seating, and vintage cabinets enhance the cozy, homey feel.</p>
      <p>Decor elements include woven baskets, ceramic jugs, farmhouse sinks, and heirloom-style accessories. Lighting fixtures such as lanterns, chandeliers, and sconces in black or bronze finishes add rustic sophistication.</p>

      <h2>Influence and Global Spread</h2>
      <p>Farmhouse design has gained widespread appeal for its ability to make any home feel welcoming and grounded. From American suburban homes to European cottages, its mix of simplicity and warmth resonates globally. The rise of farmhouse-inspired media and décor brands has helped translate this once-rural aesthetic into modern living spaces across the world.</p>

      <h2>Farmhouse Design in the Present Context</h2>
      <p>Today’s farmhouse interiors seamlessly blend rustic tradition with modern design sensibilities. Sustainable materials, minimalist furniture, and open concepts are redefining the classic farmhouse aesthetic.
