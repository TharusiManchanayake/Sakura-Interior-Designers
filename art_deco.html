        <p>Glamorous • Geometric • Luxurious</p>
      </header>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Art Deco interior design is synonymous with luxury, glamour, and modern sophistication. Emerging in the early 20th century, this style is defined by its geometric forms, bold symmetry, and opulent materials. Art Deco interiors exude confidence and drama, embracing both craftsmanship and innovation. From mirrored surfaces to metallic finishes, every element is designed to make a statement of elegance and power.</p>

      <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
      <p>The Art Deco movement originated in France during the 1920s and gained global prominence after the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris in 1925. It evolved as a reaction to the organic curves of Art Nouveau, introducing a more streamlined, structured aesthetic that celebrated progress and industrialization.</p>
      <p>In the 1930s and 1940s, Art Deco became the dominant style for architecture, interiors, and even fashion—embodying the optimism and luxury of the modern age. Though its popularity waned after World War II, its influence remains timeless in both classical and contemporary design.</p>

      <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>
      <p>The philosophy of Art Deco revolves around modernity, glamour, and order. It celebrates human achievement, innovation, and the beauty of symmetry. The style embodies a blend of artistry and machine-age precision, where handcrafted quality meets industrial materials. Art Deco interiors project confidence—each design choice feels deliberate, bold, and refined, reflecting the optimism and elegance of its era.</p>

      <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
      <p>Art Deco interiors are instantly recognizable by their geometric motifs, symmetrical layouts, and rich detailing. Patterns such as chevrons, zigzags, sunbursts, and stepped forms are common, while sleek, streamlined furniture combines functionality with flair. Mirrored panels, glossy surfaces, and metallic accents enhance the sense of glamour, and luxurious materials like marble, lacquer, and exotic woods reflect sophistication and wealth.</p>
      <p>Lighting plays a key role—chandeliers, sconces, and lamps often feature bold geometric shapes or glass designs inspired by skyscrapers and the Jazz Age.</p>

      <h2>Color Palette and Materials</h2>
      <p>The Art Deco color palette is both dramatic and refined, balancing deep, moody hues with gleaming metallics. Shades like black, emerald green, royal blue, gold, silver, ivory, and burgundy dominate interiors. Polished materials—chrome, brass, glass, mirror, and marble—are essential for creating the style’s reflective, high-luxury atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Lacquered finishes, velvet upholstery, and glossy woods such as mahogany or ebony add richness and depth. Together, they create an environment that feels simultaneously glamorous, powerful, and meticulously composed.</p>

      <h2>Furniture and Decor</h2>
      <p>Furniture in Art Deco interiors combines clean geometry with decorative craftsmanship. Pieces are often sculptural—featuring curved edges, sleek veneers, and inlays of metal or ivory. Sofas and chairs typically have bold silhouettes and are upholstered in plush materials like leather, silk, or velvet.</p>
      <p>Decor elements include stylized artwork, geometric mirrors, crystal chandeliers, and sculptural accessories inspired by Egyptian, Greek, or African art forms. Every detail contributes to a sense of refined luxury and timeless sophistication.</p>

      <h2>Influence and Global Spread</h2>
      <p>Art Deco’s global spread was swift and profound. From the skyscrapers of New York and Miami’s pastel facades to grand hotels and cinemas across Europe and Asia, the style symbolized progress and prestige. Its fusion of international influences made it adaptable across cultures—each region adding local motifs and craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>In Sri Lanka, India, and Southeast Asia, Art Deco buildings and interiors still stand as enduring icons of architectural and cultural heritage.</p>

      <p>Modern Art Deco interiors continue to celebrate luxury, symmetry, and craftsmanship—proof that nearly a century later, its bold vision of beauty and refinement remains as captivating as ever.</p>
