        <h1>Bohemian Interior Design Style — A Comprehensive Overview</h1>
        <p>Eclectic • Artistic • Free-Spirited</p>
      </header>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Bohemian interior design, often called “Boho,” celebrates creativity, individuality, and a carefree lifestyle. It embraces a mix of colors, patterns, and textures, creating spaces that feel vibrant, lived-in, and full of personality. Rooted in artistic and global influences, Bohemian interiors reject strict design rules, instead focusing on personal expression and cultural richness.</p>

      <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
      <p>The Bohemian style originated in the 19th century among European artists, writers, and travelers who lived unconventional, nomadic lifestyles. Inspired by global cultures—particularly Moroccan, Indian, and African aesthetics—Boho interiors became a fusion of ethnic motifs, handmade decor, and vintage treasures.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s and 70s, Bohemian design evolved into a symbol of freedom and counterculture, expressing individuality through eclectic decor and vibrant self-expression. Today, the style continues to evolve while maintaining its artistic, soulful essence.</p>

      <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>
      <p>The philosophy of Bohemian design is grounded in freedom, creativity, and authenticity. It encourages layering of diverse elements—old and new, ornate and simple—to tell a personal story. Boho interiors value emotion and experience over perfection, resulting in warm, inviting spaces that feel deeply connected to their inhabitants.</p>

      <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
      <p>Bohemian interiors are defined by rich textures, bold patterns, and a global mix of influences. Layered textiles, ethnic prints, and handmade items dominate the aesthetic. There’s a relaxed approach to symmetry—furniture and decor are arranged organically rather than precisely. Plants, vintage finds, and artisanal objects add character and charm to every corner.</p>
      <p>The atmosphere is cozy and collected, celebrating imperfection and the beauty of the unexpected.</p>

      <h2>Color Palette and Materials</h2>
      <p>Bohemian color palettes are warm and expressive, featuring earthy tones like terracotta, ochre, and deep greens paired with jewel hues such as turquoise, magenta, and gold. Textiles play a major role—rugs, tapestries, and cushions introduce color and pattern. Natural materials like rattan, jute, and wood mix effortlessly with metallic accents, embroidered fabrics, and woven textures.</p>

      <h2>Furniture and Decor</h2>
      <p>Bohemian furniture emphasizes comfort, storytelling, and artistry. Low seating, poufs, daybeds, and layered rugs invite relaxation. Decor includes macramé, handcrafted ceramics, vintage art, and travel souvenirs—each piece holding emotional or cultural significance. Lighting is often soft and ambient, using lanterns, string lights, or candles to create a warm glow.</p>

      <h2>Influence and Global Spread</h2>
      <p>The Bohemian style has spread worldwide, adapting to various cultural influences. In Western design, it often merges with modern or Scandinavian minimalism, creating the “modern Boho” trend. In tropical and desert regions, it reflects local craftsmanship and color traditions, showcasing the flexibility and timelessness of Boho design.</p>

      <h2>Bohemian Design in the Present Context</h2>
      <p>Today’s Bohemian interiors merge sustainability, culture, and artistry. Many modern Boho spaces feature eco-conscious materials, secondhand furnishings, and handmade decor. This design philosophy resonates strongly with those who seek authenticity, creativity, and emotional connection in their surroundings—making Bohemian style not just a look, but a lifestyle.</p>
